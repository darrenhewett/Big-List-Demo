## Proof of concept for large list of data

This code was created as a proof of concept for presenting genealogy data in a 
browser. The dataset is in the order of 10^6 entries and the requirement was
to be able to filter by first and last name.

Data is generated and stored in a JSON file on the server, loaded into an /<iron-list/> element and filtered.
